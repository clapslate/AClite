AC lite
Version 0.1
Author: Mohit Gvalani

*Overview
AC(Attendance Calculator) will help you to
- calculate your attendance
- set a target attendance
- know how many more slots you need to sit to achieve your target attendance

Slot is a period in the timetable. It is usually of 1 hour.
So a lecture of 1 hour will occupy 1 slot and a practical of 2 hours will occupy 2 slots.
AC doesn't differentiate between lectures and practicals (or tutorials). Everything is considered as a slot.
Separate attendance for lectures and practicals(of a subject) are not calculated. Attendance for a subject as a whole, is calculated.



*AC Heavy

The name of this application is AC lite. So there must be a AC heavy (AC with lots of features), and there is.
It calculates separate attendance for lectures, practicals and tutorials.
It displays the timetable which can be edited and you can also enter notes for the slots.
It can set reminders for you.
It can send an automated sms to your friend to let him/her know that you're not coming for a particular slot. (Note: You're not encouraged to use this feature for proxy purposes.)
AC heavy is under construction and is going to be in that phase for a long time (Its too complex). Its 1/3rd done.



*Menu Options for AC lite

-Create TimeTable
This is the most complex part of AC. It'll ask you to enter lecture/practical slots for all 7 days of the week, one by one. Slot duration is one hour. You just have to enter the name of the subject and timings are not needed. After you enter the lecture/practical in the first slot, it'll move on to the next slot. It asks you "Do you want to add one more slot?". If your answer is "no", it'll move on to the next day of week and cover all 7 days this way. The process can be quite time-consuming, which makes you more prone to make mistakes. But this step is necessary for obvious reasons. If you do make a mistake, reset the application. Other menu options will be available only after you finish this step.
Note: If your lecture or practical is of 2 periods, you'll have to enter it in 2 different consecutive slots. Refer 'Slot'.

-Enter Attendance
Attendance is entered for an entire day at once. If entered, it can't be undone. Be careful!


-Extra Attendance
This is for extra lectures and practicals. You have to specify, how many extra slots were conducted.


-Advanced Edit
Three values are maintained for a subject -
1. Attended - No. of slots you've attended so far.
2. Conducted - No. of slots conducted so far (including the ones you were absent in).
3. Total - Total no. of slots that will be conducted from the 1st day of your college till the last day.
These 3 values, will be shown for this menu option; for the subject you select from the drop-down menu. If you make any errors while entering your attendance, you can rectify it here.


-Reset
This will delete all data, including the timetable.
